# Vaguely Realistic

 With this mod I hope to add some challenges to how we play KSP in the stock universe, by applying some of the limitations that our real-life engineers and pilots face, for example:

- Huge reaction wheel nerf
  - Reaction wheels will be removed from certain parts to align with real life; for example, a command pod will not have any reaction wheels and will require RCS for attitude control
  - Reaction wheels will have their torque decay over time
  - Torque can be restored by de-saturating the wheels, e.g. using RCS
  - Vessel mass will be a major factor in how quickly your wheels become saturated

- Engine ignition limits
  - Limitations are provided by the mod [EngineIgniter](https://github.com/jamesharling/EngineIgniter)
  - Some engines will have a limit on the maximum number of ignitions
  - First stage engines (e.g. Mainsail) will have a single ignition
  - Upper stage engines (e.g. Rhino) will have a small number of ignitions (air start to apogee, circularisation, injection burn)
  - Service module engines (e.g. LV-909) will have many, but limited, ignitions e.g. 50
  - Monopropellant and what would be hypergolic engines (e.g. LV-1R) will have unlimited ignitions, as they don't actually need igniters!

- Solid rocket booster thrust curves
  - SRBs will have a thrust curve so thrust tails off as propellant is depleted

- Heat
  - Many parts will now generate heat that must dealt with
  - The 'hottest' parts will be crew modules. Expect your space stations to require radiators from now on!
  
- Power
  - Power requirements for parts have been vastly increased, where appropriate.
  - Crew modules and labs will be the main draw in your ships. You'll need batteries and power sources, scaled appropriately to the size of your vessel/station.
