# Vaguely Realistic

 With this mod I hope to add some challenges to how we play KSP in the stock universe, by applying some of the limitations that our real-life engineers and pilots face, for example:

- Huge reaction wheel nerf
  - Reaction wheels will have their torque decay over time
  - Torque can be restored by de-saturating the wheels, e.g. using RCS
  - Vessel mass will be a major factor in how quickly your wheels become saturated
  - Vessels such as Command Modules with a Service Module (like the Apollo CM/SM) will pretty much require RCS to be usable in any way

- Engine ignition limits
  - Some engines will have a limit on the maximum number of ignitions
  - First stage engines (e.g. Mainsail) will have a single ignition
  - Service module engines (e.g. LV-909) will have many, but limited, ignitions e.g. 20
  - Monopropellant and what would be hypergolic engines (e.g. LV-1R) will have unlimited ignitions, as they don't actually need igniters!

- Solid rocket booster thrust curves
  - SRBs will have a thrust curve so thrust tails off as propellant is depleted
